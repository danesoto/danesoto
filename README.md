- 👋 Hi, I’m @danesoto
- 👀 I’m interested in finding ways to drive web3 adoption through compelling narratives, interdisciplinary discourse, and old-fashioned talking to people and communities about what they need.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about web3 with the Crypto, Culture, and Society DAO.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with artists, writers, and coders around NFT art and publishing protocols.  
- 📫 How to reach me: @danesoto on Twitter.
